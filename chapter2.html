            <h2>Now what do I do?</h2>
            <p>My stomach lurched as I pressed entered. Before that night I had never entered the "deep web". I had always heard about it. Truth be told, I, like many novice computer users, had no idea how to access a part of the internet that wasn't accessible through a Google search. But after reading a news story on CNN about the "deep web" I knew I had to try and find it. What I wasn't expecting is what came next. To say it ruined my life is an understatement. But to say that those 3 weeks of my life weren't the 3 best weeks of my life would also be an understatement.</p>

            <p>I don't even remember the name of the website I found to learn how to get on the "deep web". But I remember feeling nervous when I was one keystroke away from accessing a part of the internet that not even the FBI could contain. My biggest fear was that my accounts would get hacked and somehow my bank accounts would be drained.</p>

            <p>So there I sat, glued to my computer screen in my tiny studio apartment. My buddy Josh had just called and asked if I wanted to go out for a round of drinks. I blew him off, this was much more interesting. I do one last Google search for how to protect your passwords from being hacked and I hit enter. What happened next blew my mind. It worked. I was in. Now what the hell do I do?
